<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
“<i>I believe that in every person is a kind of circuit which resonates to intellectual discovery- and the idea is to make that resonance work</i>” <br/>
- Carl Sagan.<br>
<br>

So let’s see what your idea is!<br/>


Make a chemical switch that comprises of a beaker and some fluid to complete the given open circuit. The circuit is to be switched off after 4 minutes automatically and if you succeed, you get to go home with the spoils.<br>

<h3><font color="blue">Problem Statement</font></h3>
Participants will be given an open circuit consisting of a bulb connected to a 9V battery. You are required to device a chemical switch that closes the circuit and light up the bulb. But the circuit should become open automatically  without any human intervention after 4 minutes. You may use gas-producing reactions and harness the gas to turn the light bulb off. A wire in the circuitry may be dipped in acid, which will react with the wire and eventually break the circuit. An iodine clock reaction may be used to trigger a switch. <img src="file:///android_asset/int/gr09_ch11_Q2(1)_resized.jpg" alt="gr09_ch11_Q2(1).jpg"/>
<h3><font color="blue">Event Specifications</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>The team can consist of a maximum of four members.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inter college teams are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Hazardous or explosive chemicals must not be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The timer will be started as soon as the setup is ready.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The circuit consists of a 9V battery and bulb connected using insulated copper wires.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The mechanism must be connected to the circuit through the alligator clips that will be a part of the provided circuit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The two wires cannot be inter-connected by any means.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The mechanism must be self-contained and must fit on a table two feet wide and six feet long.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> No human intervention is allowed in between. The bulb should get switched off automatically.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The mechanism must not leave any residue on the table or surrounding area.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The mechanism must not spill any liquids or release any sprays.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The light bulb must not be turned off by destroying it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All the chemicals required should be brought by the participants itself.</li>
</ul>
<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>
<b></b><ul>
<li> The judging will be based on how close the circuit gets opened to the specified time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The teams will be disqualified if the circuit gets broken before 1 minute or after 5 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> The mechanism with exact time of action wins the event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> In case no team comes up with the exact 4 min breaker circuit, the team with closest time of circuit break wins.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
