Are you up to the challenge?

<h3><font color="blue">PROBLEM STATEMENT </font></h3>
<i><b>The objective of this event is to build a GSM bot that can navigate using your instructions transmitted by a mobile phone. The bot is then used to traverse a maze in a specified time.</b></i><br/>


<h3><font color="blue">DESCRIPTION</font></h3>


The event comprises of two rounds.<br/>  <b>First round (R1)</b><br/>
The participants are required to move their bot through a given maze. Winners of this round will enter the finals. Participants who fail this round are given a second chance through a <b><br/>
Parallel round(R2)</b>  which shall judge  the team&apos;s design and technique. Those who pass this alternative round(R2) can also enter the final round. <br/><b> Last round(R3)</b> <br/> The event winners will be decided based on only the last round(R3)which will be revealed on the spot. The finals(R3) tests the expertise of the participants and skills of the bot.<br/>

<h3><font color="blue">SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
 <b>BOT SPECIFICATIONS<br/></b>


<ol>
<li>	Machine should fit in a box of dimensions <b>0.40 m * 0.25 m*0.5m</b> (length *breadth *height)at the start of the event.<br/></li>

<li>	The weight of the GSM bot should not exceed 1 kg.<br/></li>
</ol>

<br/>

  <b>CONTROL AND PROPULSION<br/>

</b>

<ol>

<li>The machine should be controlled by GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally GroupeSp√©cial Mobile) mechanism throughout the event. <br/></li>

<li>	It should not be controlled by IR beams, Bluetooth radiowaves or any other type of wireless communication other than GSM. Readymade SMS kits are not allowed. However participants can manually build their own SMS kits or modules which can be interfaced with the bot.<br/></li>

<li>	The machine must not be made from Lego parts, or any ready-made assembly kits. Readily available chassis layouts are not allowed. Any machine having a ready-made chassis will be disqualified or they will face a significant reduction of points depending on the discretion of judges.<br/></li>

<li>	All machines have to use an on-board power supply. No external power supply will be allowed. Teams must bring their own power supply for their machines.<br/></li>

<li>	The method of propulsion is at the discretion of the builder, provided that the power source is non-polluting. In case the machine is using a non-electric power supply, kindly get it approved from the organisers beforehand via email.<br/><br/></li>
</ol>
<br/>

<b>TEAM SPECIFICATIONS<br/>
</b>
<ol>
<li>	Each team can consist of a maximum of 4 members.<br/></li>
<li>	Team members have to produce valid ID card of the institute.</li>
<li>Inter-college teams are permitted .<br/></li>

</ol>

<h3><font color="blue">JUDGEMENT CRITERIA</font></h3>
<ol>
<li>	A dimension test will be conducted. The bot have to complete its path within the specified maximum time allotted in round 1 (R1).<br/></li>

<li>	 Innovative designs can also fetch extra points. <br/></li>

<li>	Any human intervention after dimension test will lead to deduction of points.<br/></li>
<li>	The score scheme for transversing a maze in R1 will be as follows :<br/>2000-2*t-n*c<br/>
t = Time taken in seconds (a maximum of 10 minutes), <br/>n = Number of corrections, <br/>
c = Points deducted for each correction<br/></li>

<li>	The participant with the bot can place it at the previous stable position if it slips off from the original position, for which correction points will be deducted.<br/></li>
<li>	In case of a tie in the final round, R1 marks will be used to break the tie.<br/></li>

<li>	The event winner is decided solely from the final round(R3) , the details of which will be provided on the spot. R3 will be a maze round with innovative modifications.<br/></li>

<li>	Judges decisions will be final, and any of the above mentioned rules can change according to the scenario of the event . Selection rate for R3 is more from R1 than R2.</li>

</ol>
<h3><font color="blue">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</font></h3>
<ol>
<li>Only teams with verified designs are eligible for participating in the finals.</li>

<li>In case of any alternation, judges' decision will be admitted as final.<br/></li>

<li>A certain amount of time is allowed before getting disqualified in case the bot does not start in R1.<br/></li>

<li>Awarding prize money shall be subject to extent of faithful completion of the event.<br/></li>

<li>In a case where a majority of the participants fail in the final round,the result shall be judges' discretion.</li>
</ol>
