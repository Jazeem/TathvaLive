Time and tide waits for none. Are you swift and sturdy enough to beat time and emerge a winner from this pacific rim?
Fabricate an RC boat that speeds up through the checkpoints. Let your thirst for victory, your desire to create and your passion to pioneer escort you to that handsome finish line. 

Bring in your ideas and innovations and be the new flying dutchman!

<h3><font color="blue"> PROBLEM STATEMENT</font></h3>
<b><i>
  You are required to make a remote controlled boat either wired or wireless. Every team will be 
racing their boat along the same track. The track will be twisty, curvy and will have waves to slow you down. The boat taking the least time to complete the track will win.

<h3><font color="blue">RULES AND REGULATIONS</font></h3>
<b>Team Specification</b><br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>A team can consist of a minimum of one member and a maximum of five members.</li>
<li>The participants should produce a valid identity card of their institute.</li>
<li>Cross college teams are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<b>General Rules</b> <br/><br/>

<ul>
<li> The boats are not allowed to leave any loose parts on any part of the arena. Any machine disintegrating during the race will be disqualified.</li>
<li> The teams may obtain a time slot for practice before the game. Any requests for using the track at any other time will not be entertained.</li>

<li> Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be eliminated from the competition automatically.</li>
<li> Elevated standing will be provided for wired boats. Participants are not allowed to move through water.</li>

<li> Decision of judges will be final and applicable to all.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

 
<b>Track Specification</b><br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li> The race track will be a track with left, right and U turns, S-shaped curves and hurdles.</li>

<li> Despite organizers' efforts to keep the track quality intact, if the track shakes slightly because of the ripples, participants should be able to control their boat accordingly.</li>
<li> The exact track will be revealed only on the day of the race.</li>
<li> A lap of the track is defined to be completed when the boat comes back to the start-finish line.</li>
<li> Remote control should be capable to cover a range of at least 20 feet so as to complete the race without failure.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<b>Dimension and Fabrication</b><br/>
<br/>

• Maximum length of the boat: 30cm.<br/>

• Maximum width of the boat: 30cm<br/>

• Maximum height of the boat: 30cm<br/>
• The boats can be wired or wireless.<br/>
• The boat must not be made from Lego parts, or any ready-made assembly kits.<br/>
• External remote controllers can be used. <br/>
• Propellers or paddles and steering mechanisms should be self designed and made (Ready made kits are not allowed!)
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Motor specifications</b>
<br/>
<br/>

 <ul>
<li>The boat must have an onboard power supply to provide power to any mechanism requiring electric power.</li>
<li> Use of any energy storage devices such as capacitors (other than batteries) is not allowed.</li>

<li> Only dc motor should be used.</li>
<li> The maximum allowable speed of the electric motor is 7000 r.p.m. (Please keep in mind that the path will be curved, twisty and with hurdles!)</li>
<li> The electric voltage provided to the motor shaft should not be more than 12V.</li>
<li> Speed controller may be used so as to control the speed of the dc motor.</li>

</ul>

 
<h3><font color="blue">JUDGING CRITERIA</font></h3>
You are required to navigate your boat through the given path in minimum time. There will be various markers which if taken will earn you bonus points. If the vehicle touches any of the edge-walls, a penalty of 5 seconds will be added to the timer. Any kind of human intervention will lead to the addition of a penalty of 15 seconds to the timer and the boat will also be reset to the previous checkpoint<br/>
<br/>
Score will be calculated as follows<br/><br/>


s = t +15h + 5c – 5m<br/><br/>


t=total time taken to complete a lap,<br/>
         
           h=no of human interventions<br/>

           c=no of collisions with circuit boundaries<br/>

           m=no of markers taken<br/>

The team with minimum s will be the winner.
