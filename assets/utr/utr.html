<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>

‘The Engineer, inspired by the law of Economy and governed by mathematical calculation, puts us in accord with universal law. He achieves harmony. 
The Architect, by his arrangement of forms, realizes an order which is a pure creation of his spirit; by forms and shapes he affects our senses to an acute degree and provokes plastic emotions; by the relationships which he creates he wakes profound echoes in us, he gives us the measure of an order which we feel to be in accordance with that of our world, he determines the various movements of our heart and of our understanding; it is then that we experience the sense of beauty. 
Modern life demands, and is waiting for, a new kind of plan, both for the house and for the city. ‘
Today dreaming of or imagining better societies is usually called "utopianism," and it can be expressed in a variety of ways. 
From its earliest expression to the present, a basic human utopia is found in which everyone has adequate food, shelter, and clothing gained without debilitating labor and in which people lead secure lives without fear of  wild animals, and or even other human  beings. But these basic elements are expressed in different ways in different times and places and also reflect individual concerns; as a result, the range of utopias present throughout history is immense.
Utopia characterizes subordinate social positions; it reflects the desire to escape from reality. 
The pedagogical aim of this design project is to improve progressive thinking and critical thought in the design education of architectural students — and also future architects.
The challenge is not just the idea of an alternative society but also the idea of a different space.
Utopia, as an inter-disciplinary subject, brings various issues and different perspectives into the design process such as public and private realms, everyday life, work, leisure, nature, technology and sustainability. The concept of utopia, should enable students to criticise the existing world, dream about an alternative one and make the design of their dreams in a creative way.
Excerpt from  Le Corbusier’s  Towards a New Architecture (1923)
‘The history of Architecture unfolds itself slowly across the centuries as a modification of structure and ornament, but in the last fifty years steel and concrete have brought new conquests, which are the index of a greater capacity for construction, and of an architecture in which the old codes have been overturned. If we challenge the past, we shall learn that "styles" no longer exist for us, that a style belonging to our own period has come about; and there has been a Revolution. Architecture is one of the most urgent needs of man, for the house has always been the indispensable and first tool that he has forged for himself.  We are all pursuing one aim: to make a paradise on Earth. ‘

<h3><font color="blue">Intention</font></h3>
If tall trees can pump water to its tip why does a building need machines to pump it up! -  if this is how a biotechnology student would think on building design.
How will you Think?!!

<h3><font color="blue">Design Problem</font></h3>

To design a residence for the year 2513 , foreseeing the major needs of human beings of that period. The design should dwell not just into the drawings but into the specified materials as well. 

<ol>
<li>shelter</li>
<li>food and water</li>
<li>rest/sleep</li>
<li>workspace/leisure space</li>
</ol>
Site selection is flexible; can be either on land ,water or space.
