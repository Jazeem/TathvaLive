<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
<br>
There is blood on the wall and a body on the 
floor, other than these all seemed obvious. But the world is full of obvious things which nobody ever observes. You have heard what everybody has heard. You have seen what everybody has seen. You see, but do you observe? No trail is to be found, yet the chase is onâ€¦'The game is afoot. Not a word! Into your clothes and come!'.<br/>
Beyond the impossible, glory awaits.
