<br>
Prepare yourself for competing with other amazing minds in C/C++<br/>
The problems involve many issues related to real world programming, thus providing you with the opportunity to polish your coding skills and come up with the simplest and the most efficient code.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you fancy yourself as a code guru, join the battle and prove your skills in coding. The one armed with quickness, simplicity and innovation will emerge the winner.

<h3><font color="blue">Event Specification</font></h3>
There will be a total of 3 rounds. An extra round may be conducted in case of ties in the last round.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Round 1</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>This is a written round mainly intended to test your foundations in C/C++ and your general programming skills.</li>
<li>Questions will be both objective and subjective.</li>
<li>A total of 15-20 teams will be shortlisted depending on participation.</li>
</ul>
<b>Round 2</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>This round will also be a written round.</li>
<li>It will be a rapid fire round and you are expected to attempt multiple questions in a limited time frame. </li>
<li>Syntactical errors will be penalized.</li>
<li>Short and elegant solutions will be awarded extra marks.</li>
</ul><br/>

<b>Round 3</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>In this round you will be provided with a terminal with gcc/g++ compilers pre-loaded.</li>
<li>Your team working abilities will be put to test in this round.</li>
<li>Each team will be provided a set of inter-related questions. Team members have to code for partial solutions independently on different systems.</li>
<li>Some initial time will be provided for communication and devising plan of action.</li>
<li>Final result will be based on the combination of partial solutions.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Rules</font></h3>
<ol>
<li>Coding should be done in <b>C/C++</b> languages only.</li>
<li> A team should consist of exactly <b>2 members</b>. One member teams are not entertained.</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Teamwork</b>, <b>coding skills</b> and <b>algorithms</b> used will be the basis for evaluation.</li>
<li><b>Short</b> and <b>elegant</b> solutions will be awarded extra marks. </li>
<li>Points will not be carried over to subsequent rounds except in case of ties. </li>
<li>In round 2, partial solutions lacking clarity of thought will not be awarded marks. </li>
<li>For round 3, your codes will be tested against standard test cases set by the coordinators. Partial marks will be awarded for each test case. </li>
<li>Rules and regulations are subject to change based on the availability of time and resources. </li>
