<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
<b><ul>"We cannot solve our problems with the same level of thinking that created them.”</ul></b>
<br>
Neuro-linguist programming helps to understand how our brain and the brain of others work. NLP concentrates on studying the inner self and the way that individuals structure their subjective experience, the way each of us thinks about our own values, beliefs and past experiences. Our brain is very similar to a computer. Just as it is possible to reprogram a computer, it is also possible to reprogram our mind. NLP has many tools which are extensively used by corporate managers the world over. This workshop is a combination of Neuro Linguistic programming (NLP) & Experiential Learning methods like exercises, role plays, instruments, interactive discussions, mental gymnastics, indoor teambuilding / creativity games.
