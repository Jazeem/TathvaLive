<h3><font color="blue">Event Specifications</font></h3>

The robot is expected to solve the maze and find the shortest path and reach other side of the arena. The game begins as soon as the teams are given the folder enclosing the images for processing. The shortest path should be determined by processing the live video feed from an overhead camera.

<h3><font color="blue">Arena Specifications</font></h3>

<br/>
<ul>
<li>	The background of the arena will be white.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	The line following principle is to be accomplished by following the lines of thickness 3 cm in the track.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	A USB Camera will be fixed above the arena at some height. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	The position of the camera will be fixed with respect to the arena.</li>
</ul>
Note: The height and resolution of the camera and dimensions of the arena will be specified later.

<h3><font color="blue">Robot Specifications</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>	Dimensions of robot should not exceed 20 X 15 X 24 cm.</li>
</ul>
Organizers will be testing the dimensions.
<ul>
<li>	Power supplies for the laptop will be provided externally.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Use of on-board camera is not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>During the game the robot should remain as one part and should not split into separate parts in the arena.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	The communication between the laptop and the robot can be wired or wireless.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The file for processing is to be copied to the respective teams’ laptop prior to the event.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Event Rules</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>	The robot is to be surrendered to the event coordinators prior to the official start of the event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	The code for imageprocessing will be verified by the judges and the final selection of the teams may depend on this.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	The score scheme will be as follows:</li>
</ul>

	<i>TOTAL = 1000/ (t*n) + BONUS-PENALTY
t = Time taken in seconds (a maximum of 10 minutes),
n = Number of corrections,</i>
<ul>
<li>	Decision of the judges will be final, and any of the above mentioned rules can change according to the scenario of the event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Outstanding design will get additional 30 points as bonus.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Any variation in the size of robot will lose 30 points as penalty.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Disqualification</font></h3>

<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Robot leaving the arena and/or any of the participants entering the arena.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Usage of any extra sensor on the robot, other than those used for line-following.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Any usages of control signals other than those sent by the laptop outside the arena.</li>
</ul>
