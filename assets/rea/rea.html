<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
Self compacting concrete has become an indispensible need for engineers given the constraints normally associated with the congestion of reinforcement, non-availability of skilled labour and difficulty in places of fresh concrete.<br/>

Here at tathva’13 we invite you to come up with your own design mix of concrete having a better self compaction in the most economical manner.<br/>

<h3><font color="blue">PROBLEM STATEMENT</font></h3>
The sample mix (M40 Grade) submitted by the participating team will be subjected to Self Compacting Concrete tests.

<h3><font color="blue">SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
1.	The participating team is supposed to bring the required materials for the SELF COMPACTING CONCRETE TEST at the laboratory of NIT CALICUT.<br/>

2.	The participating team is supposed to perform the test in front of the judges.SCC apparatus will be made available to the participating team.<br/>

3.	The mix prepared must be in agreement with M40 (AS PER IS CODES).<br/>

4.	The participating team must provide sufficient data about the sample regarding:<br/>

•	Weight of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate,other materials water used.<br/>

•	Sieve analysis details,specific gravity of materials used.<br/>

5.	The event will be strictly conducted on the first day of tathva.<br/>

6.	Maximum number of candidates per team is 3.<br/>

7.The participating team must possess a valid tathva id card.

<h3><font color="blue">JUDGING CRITERIA</font></h3>
1. The most appropriate test results -40% weightage.<br/>

2.The mix with minimum cement to aggregate ratio (by weight)-30% weightage.<br/>

 3.The sample details provided by the participating team -10% weightage.
  4.The remaining 20% weightage will be given depending on the results obtained from on spot tests.
