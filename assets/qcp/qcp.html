<b>SURVEILLANCE QUADCOPTER DESIGN</b>:
<br>
A Quadcopter is a helicopter that is propelled by four rotors. Among the first successful heavier-than-air take off and landing vehicles, the study of modelling a Quadcopter is the perfect blend of aerodynamics and multi rotor technology. With exclusive hands-on sessions that help deeply improve the technical know- how of copter designing, this workshop is the ultimate stop for aero dynamic modelling and Quadcopter technology enthusiasts.
<br>
          So build a solid foundation at “Quadcopter” and let your innovations guide you through the flight!

<h3><font color="blue">WOKSHOP HIGHLIGHTS</font></h3>

 <ul>
<li>There will be hands on sessions on every topic from design to making of Quadcopters. These Hands on sessions will be really helpful to those who want to dwell in the field of aero-modelling and design of Quadcopters.</li>
<li> Each team of four gets a workshop kit worth Rs.4000/- </li>
<li> By the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to build their own Quadcopters using the kit provided.</li>
<li>Participants will also learn how to interface a camera in the Quadcopter such that images and videos of remote places can be taken using it and the copter can be used for surveillance purposes inside and outside a building.</li>
