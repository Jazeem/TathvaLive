<h3><font color="blue">EVENT SPECIFICATION</font></h3>
<b>ROUND 1</b>
<ul>
<li>This round will be a general and electrical aptitude MCQ round. Top 10 teams will be qualified to the second round. 
</li>
</ul>
<b>ROUND 2</b>
<ul>
<li>The second round will be purely electrical aptitude and will be testing the deep knowledge in basics of electrical science. For this, each team will be given 10 questions one after another. Only after answering/skipping a question, a team will be given the next question. If they answer correctly, 5 points will be awarded, no points will be awarded for a skipped question and -1 will be the penalty for a wrong answer. If any team is stuck in a question, they can ask for a clue. But clue will have a penalty of -2 points. So there are six ways of scoring: 
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>	Answering correctly without a clue : 5 points</li>
<li>	Skipping		              	      : 0 points</li>
<li>	Wrong answer			      : -1 point</li>
<li>	Answering correctly with clue     	                  :     3 points</li>
<li>	Skipping after asking a clue	      : -2 points</li>
<li>	Wrong answer after asking clue       : -3 points</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A team cannot skip more than 3 questions.  When  a team completes all the 10 questions, the round will be over. The overall marks of each team will then be calculated and the top 5 teams will be qualified to the final round.</li>
</ul>
<b>FINAL ROUND</b>
<ul>
<li>This round is a hands-on round where a problem statement and equipments will be provided for each team using which the solution should be implemented as an electrical circuit. 50 points will be awarded for the winners of this round ,30 for runner ups and 20 for 2nd runner ups. </li>
</ul>
