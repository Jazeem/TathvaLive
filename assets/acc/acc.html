<ul>
<li>The arena would span a total area of 4.5m x 2.5m . The inner width of the track through which the bot has to travel will be 35cm. The whole of the track would be bounded by boulders.  The course will offer a number of hurdles and flag points , crossing which, you can earn extra points.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There will be two paths, one long, flat path and the other, a shorter  bridge inclined at a maximum angle of 30 degrees. The participants are free to decide the path to be taken by their bot. </li>
</ul>
<h3> <font color="blue">MACHINE SPECIFICATION</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> The maximum dimension allowed for  the bot is 20*20*12 cm. Also, the bot should be no smaller than 6cm * 5cm * 2cm.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The  machine should be controlled by a wireless/wired mechanism that uses only wrist movement  to manipulate the movement of vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The machine cannot be made from lego parts or any readymade assembly kits. Readymade microcontroller -boards, readymade sensors kits and accelerometers may be used.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Power supply for  the system will not be provided.</li>
</ul>
<h3> <font color="blue">CONTROLS</font></h3>
