Swadeshi Science Movement (Kerala Chapter of VijnanaBharati, India) is a popular Science Movement with a total commitment to the Swadeshi Spirit and approach in Science and Technology. The motto of Swadeshi Science Movement is "Science is neither for revolution nor for exploitation, but it is for social harmony and integral development".
The movement aims to showcase our glorious past and revive the past scientific traditions which are fast fading in the present times. &apos;Vedasastra&apos; will be the prime focus in the exhibition. An overview of the Vedas-the Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Samaveda and Atharvaveda will be given and it is sure to inspire us to return to these sound practices. Samhitas by Aryabhata, Varahamihira and Bhaskara provide invaluable knowledge about the depth of Vedic Mathematics. VaastuShastra is another special attraction which will garner the appreciation and praise of the general public.
