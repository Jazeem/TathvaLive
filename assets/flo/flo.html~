Is concrete denser than water?</center>

<br><br>
Density of concrete completely depends on its constituents the precise value of which will be varying depending on the type and amount of its constituent particles. Here, at <b>Flottant</b> you have a chance to design your own floating concrete structures.<br><br>

<h3><font color="blue">Event Specifications</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>3 cubes of size (15 cm x15 cmx15 cm) with a tolerance of 7mm have to be submitted.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are no restrictions on the materials in the concrete.But every material that is used should be mentioned in the Report.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Only cubes of age 7 days will be allowed for the participation of the event.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There will be 3 rounds 
<ul>
<li>Preliminary round: Cube should float in water, Percentage of floating  will be given a special weightage </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Report Presentation: Team should submit a report duly signed by the guide. If report is not submitted in the prescribed manner then, the team may get disqualified. Members are requested to present report in power point format.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Compressive strength test.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Team should present the video of cube casting in mp4 or Avi. Format(Projector and laptops will be provided for presentation)</li>
</ul>
