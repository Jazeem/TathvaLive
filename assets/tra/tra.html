“ If you gotta do something, do it yourself…!!!” but  here at TRANSPOTER we are just to do the opposite.<br/><br/>

The day man started becoming lazy, he sought out for temporary  substitutes for himself and thus starts the  story of the TECH MONSTORS , ROBOTS…From wheels to mountain sized equipments, the aim was simple,to reduce human labour. 
In TRANSPORTER, you get a small taste of this by designing and building your own robot to transport specific object to desired locations under the ticking clock. And this time, the fun increases  a hidden twist about the terrain which would be revealed only at the venue….<br/><br/>

So the secret is put your laziness to test, who knows what shortcut ideas you might come up with… 
.<br/><br/>


<h3><font color="blue">PROBLEM STATEMENT</font></h3>

Round 1 <br>
The participant has to build a manual robot that can pick up weights from a location and place them in a different location in the arena in a specified time.<br/>
<br>
Round 2 <br>
Will be declared soon

<h3><font color="blue">COMPETITION RULES</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>	The mission is to move all the ten blocks from Area 1 to Area 3 in a stipulated time. The team moving 3 blocks via track A or the team moving 1 block via track B shall qualify into the competition. The team transporting the maximum number of blocks shall be declared the winner in each round. Time limit for route A is 10 minutes and that for route B is 15 minutes.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	At the beginning the participant has to place his robot in Area 1, where the blocks are kept. 2 minutes will be given to each team to set up their robot.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	If the robot drops the block anywhere in the arena, negative points will be given, however the robot can continue from that location itself.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	In case of any technical problems with the robot, the team can work on it and start from the same state. However timer won’t be stopped<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	Points at the end of stipulated time is:</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Route 1: A-(Time taken in seconds) + (Number of blocks transported)*100
<br/>
Route 2: B-(Time taken in seconds) + (Number of blocks transported)*100
<br/>
Values of A and B shall only be disclosed at the venue of competition...<br/>

<ul>
<li>	The robot should not leave the arena at any point of time during the competition. Also, the robot should not touch anything outside the arena during the course of the competition.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	Any damage caused by the machine to the blocks or the arena would lead to the immediate disqualification of the team.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>	The robot should start from Area 1 and reach at Area 3 only through one of the two specified routes.<br/></li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">ARENA SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>

<img src="file:///android_asset/tra/Transpo Arena(1)_resized.jpg" alt="Transpo Arena(1).jpg"/></center>
<br/><br/>
The Arena consists of three areas:<br/>
<br/>

<u><b>AREA 1:</b></u>
The robot shall start from this zone(any one of the regions shown in blue).
Dimension: 1.2 m * 0.7 m(length*breadth)<br/>

<br/>
<b><u>AREA 2:</u></b>
Consists of two separate routes. Route A shown in green color. The slope has a maximum height of 10 cm. The path has a width of 40 cm. Length of the slope is 25 cm. Route B shown in red color too has a path width of 40 cm.The slopes has a maximum elevation of 10 cm and length 25 cm.Route A has a full length of 0.85 m and in Route B, each of the flat parts have a length of 0.4 m. <br/>
<br/>


<u><b>AREA 3:</b></u>
Area 3 and Area 1 are of the same dimension and hence have a dimension of 1.2 m * 0.7 m
<br/>

<h3><font color="blue">BLOCK SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
A total of 20 cylindrical blocks each of an approximate weight 150 gm (within 10% error) will be available at Area 1.The cylinder will have a base diameter of 4 cm and height 8 cm and will be made of wood. The blocks however will have a metallic semicircular ring(of non-magnetic material) on top.<br/>

<h3><font color="blue">ROBOT SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>

<u><b>ROBOT FABRICATION</b></u><br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>Base of the machine must not be greater than 0.35 m x 0.25 m x 0.5 m. Boundary of the base is defined by the points on the machine touching the ground in the horizontal position. The machine should fit into a box, not to exceed the above constraints.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The dimension constraints mentioned above are only for the machine and are not applicable for the external wired/wireless remote control used to control the machine manually or the power supply ( if the machine uses an external placed power supply ).<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>During the game, the machine can expand or detach itself into multiple parts provided it does not damage the arena in any way. The judges hold the right to subjectively determine if the machine violates this clause.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>Machines cannot be constructed using readymade Lego kits or any readymade mechanism but use of readymade gear assemblies is allowed. Violating this clause will lead to disqualification of the machines. Judges hold the right to subjectively evaluate this clause.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<u><b>ROBOT PROPULSION</b></u><br/><br/>
<ul>
<li>The Machine can use an externally placed or on-board electric or non-electric power supply. Use of compressors is not allowed. However, the power supply must be non-polluting and must satisfy the safety constraints determined by the judges. In case the machine is using a non-electric power supply, kindly get it approved from the organizers beforehand via email. Organizers are not responsible for inconvenience if approval is not sought.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The method of propulsion is at the discretion of the builder, provided it does not damage the arena in any way and it satisfies the safety constraints determined by the judges. The judges hold the right to subjectively determine if the machine violates this clause.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In case of an electric power supply, the voltage at any point on the machine must be lower than or equal to 12V throughout the game.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>The organizers will provide a standard 12V, 1A DC power supply.Any extension cords, eliminators, adaptors etc. required should be arranged by the participants themselves.<br/><br/></li>
</ul>




<u><b>ROBOT CONTROLS</b></u><br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li>The Machine has to be necessarily controlled by some wired/wireless remote control mechanism at all stages of the game.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>In case of wired mechanism, the wire must be slack at any point of time during the game.<br/></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The total length of wire extending from the remote control to the machine must be minimum of 3 meters.<br/></li>
</ul>


<ul>
<li>If the Machine is using a external wireless remote control , make sure that it has sufficient range and that it can control the machine well without any lag <br/><br/></li>
</ul>


<h3><font color="blue">GENERAL RULES</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>               The teams must adhere to the spirit of healthy competition.<br/></li>
