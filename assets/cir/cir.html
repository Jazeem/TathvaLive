<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
This is an event that will put to test your skills in circuit assembly. Do you love to play with resistors, transistors, diodes or more ? Then here is where you should be. We don&apos;t test your grey cells... just show us how quick you can be&hellip;<br/>

<b>Round 1</b> </a>:<br>
The first Round is an elimination round. This round consists of two sections. The first section  will be an MCQ round wherein you have to complete the paper in half an hour. The questions will be on general electrical engineering and logical reasoning. This is followed by a crossword puzzle which will give you the clue for cracking the next round.
Utmost 12 teams will be allowed to enter the second round.
<br><br>
<b>Round 2</b></a>:<br>
 Each team is supposed to assemble a circuit using all the components given to them. The details of the circuit to be made will be obtained from the solution of the crossword puzzle in the last round .The circuit diagram won&apos;t be given to the teams. The circuit will be a common important circuit that engineers ought to be familiar with. However if the team is unable to design the required circuit they can ask for the circuit diagram and complete the circuit [points will be deducted accordingly]. The team should complete the circuit within the allotted time  and marks are awarded for the speed and neatness of the working circuit.
Only 6 teams will be allowed to go to the final round.
<br><br>
<b>Final Round</b></a>:<br>
 Each team is given three different circuit diagrams and the required components. Team members can work on one circuit each. After certain time there is a buzzer and the team members are to switch their circuits (interchange the circuits with each other). The team members are then expected to carry on building the circuit that they now have in hand. <i>Please note that you will not be allowed to converse with your teammates during this round, you will not be allowed to check on your team member's progress and neither will you be allowed to work on a circuit unless it is your turn to work on that circuit. </i><br>
  Be warned, it is not as easy as it sounds.
