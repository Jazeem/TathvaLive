<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>

   Bridges have become one of the most significant structures in a modern civilization. With the designs improving on a daily basis, these bridges are capable of carrying immense loads. 
<p><br/>
    We at <i>eRECthion </i> provide you an opportunity to exhibit your bridge designing skills.
</p>

<h3><font color="blue">Problem Statement</font></h3>
<b><i>Construct the most efficient bridge using limited number of ice-cream sticks satisfying the given specifications.</i></b>

<h3><font color="blue">Rules</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> Each team will be provided with 250 ice sticks and limited quantity of adhesive.</li>
<li> Measuring instruments (rulers), cutting instruments (blades, scissors) will be provided on request.</li>
<li> Participants are not allowed to carry any material of their own.</li>
<li> Time limit is maximum 3 hours including time for drying.</li>
<li>The teams can consist a maximum of 4 and a minimum of 2 members</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Bridge Specifications</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> The bridge should have a minimum clear span of 600 mm between the supports.</li>
<li> The height of the bridge must be atleast 200 mm measured from the top of the end support. The bridge may extend 65 mm below the end supports.</li>
<li> The bridgeâ€™s main span should have a minimum length of 650 mm and should not exceed 700 mm.</li>
<li> The roadway should be continuous and should allow a 10 cm * 10 cm bridge to pass the entire length of the bridge.</li>
<li> The width of the bridge should not exceed 12.5 cm.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>
<ul>
<li> The model will be disqualified if it fails to meet the mentioned specifications.</li>
<li> Roadbed test: A standard ping pong ball rolled from one end of the bridge should reach the other end. For this the bridge will be kept at 20 degree inclination and the ball will be rolled from one end. The models failing this test will be disqualified.</li>
<li> The bridge will be loaded at a point 100 mm to the right of the center of the bridge. The loading will be continued till failure. The base load will be 5 Kg and incremented. </li>
<li> Failure of a bridge is defined as the inability of the bridge to carry any additional load, or a      load deflection of 30 mm under the loading, whichever occurs first.</li>
<li> The bridge with highest structural efficiency (E) will be declared the winner.  

<i>E= Load supported in kg/ Mass of the bridge</i>
</li>
<li> Judges will have the final say.</li>
</ul>
