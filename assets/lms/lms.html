<br/>


The event aims at an autonomous line-maze solving bot which automatically finds it way and finally reaches the destination and finds it way back. 
The event is comprised of two rounds.<br/>
FIRST ROUND :
<br/>
In this round the bot is supposed to follow the set of lines with no loop, without going out of the line.  <br/>

SECOND ROUND : <br/>
This is the round where the bot is supposed to solve the maze in minimum time.<br/>


<b><u>Liability</u></b><br/>


NITC and/or the organizing team members will never be held responsible nor liable for any incidents and / or accidents caused by participating teams or their equipment.</li>
</ul>
<u><b><br/>
Declaration of the Winner</b></u><br/>

The winner will be decided on the the basis of the performance in solving the maze. The decision of the judges will be final and binding. Any complaints regarding this will not be entertained after the results are announced.

<h3><font color="blue">RULES AND REGULATIONS</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Ready-made kits are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Solving a maze means reaching the center of the maze and finding the way back to the starting position. Finding the shortest path will be appreciated.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Line-maze solver bot must be fully autonomous and must not have any connections what so ever with any external power sources.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Line-maze solver bot must be able to solve the maze independent of any other computational sources and wired or wireless connections to such devices are not allowed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Under no circumstances shall the Line-maze solver bot be removed from the maze once it has entered the same. Anyway it is permitted to fine tune the bot before the competition starts .  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The Line-maze solver bot will be disqualified if it fails to follow the lines and wander off at some point. In the event of such an incident, if the bot finds another line which belongs to the maze in question and is successful at following that the bot can remain in the competition .</ul>
</li>
<ul>
<li>In the event of NO bot solving the maze, the one which succeeded in solving the the most percentage of the maze will be awarded first. There will be a minimum expected percentage to be completed for winning the competition which will be decided by the judges.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In the event of more winners than decided an extra round will be conducted with an advanced maze. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The finer details of the rules are subjected to change though there will not be any 
changes in the basic rules and regulations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bot will be allowed to be removed from the maze only if it stops in the middle of the lines or reaches the destination.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The bot will not be allowed to re enter the maze once it has wandered off.</li>
</ul>

FLEXIBILITY OF RULES<br/><br/>
