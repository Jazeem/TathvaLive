I was 6 years old when I persuaded my grandmother to stay up whole night and narrate the stories of fairyland. She did that with love. I was 10 years old, when I questioned my father why a parrot flies and a cat doesn&apos;t. He answered me with joy. I was 12 years old when I asked my mother why the sky is blue and leaves are green. She answered me with a smile. I was 15 years old when I asked my teacher why we feel cooler when we switch on the fan and warmer when we rub our hands. She answered me with assurance. Life was new, and questions were many. But, there was always someone to hold our hand and teach that every single lesson of life worth remembering forever.<b>Every child deserves that one magic key that unlocks all the doors that have answers to suffice his or her inquisitiveness</b>. I wish to create that magic key for every child. Would you like to join me?
<h3><font color="blue">Objective</font></h3>
<br><b>If a child cannot learn in the way we teach, we must teach in a way the child can learn.</b><p><br/>

We aim to create a database of video lectures in different vernacular languages in order to increase the penetration of high quality learning tools in villages and far flung areas where English is not the medium of instruction. The project also strives to cover different scientific and non-scientific facts and concepts which will help in triggering incisive thoughts and in turn provoking ground breaking innovations from each and every part of India. <p><p><br/>

This is an open source project which thrives to harness the knowledge of thousands of Indians and give them a way to contribute to the society with whatever knowledge they have acquired to bridge the rural and urban education gap. The education for us is not just the curriculum which is followed in our schools. It is any form of knowledge that you want to share with generations to come.<br/><p><p>

<h3><font color="blue">General Guidelines</font></h3>
<br>&bull;	The video should be made using very simple language, so that a student of any standard can understand it. Avoid using highly technical terms, try replacing them with common terms.<br/><br/>

 

&bull;	Try explaining things using common examples prevalent in our day to day life so that students can relate everything to their real life experience. We want them to absorb concepts rather than just accepting them.<br/>
<br/>


&bull;	If you are creating the video in a language other than English, please mention the English description of the technical term, once, wherever used in the lecture.
<br/>
<br/>

&bull;	Use of black/white board to explain a concept is encouraged as it makes the session interactive. Even figures and explanations done on paper sheets can be scanned or video graphed and included.
<br/>
<br/>

&bull;	Search from the available resources on internet. Innovative concepts may enrich the learning experience making the students to think out of the box.
<br/>
<br/>

&bull;	If possible demonstrate the concept by simple experiments and also suggest related activities which the students can do on their own.
<br/>
<br/>

&bull;	Use of attractive pictures, video clips in the lecture is encouraged. If you are borrowing any picture or video be sure to obtain proper permissions from the owner of the video/picture before including it in the lecture. Including photographs or pictures or video clips of your own is always better.
<br/>
<br/>
<i><b>How shall the videos capture inquisitiveness?</b></i><p><br/>

We want to find answers to those unanswered inquisitive questions asked by a child which most often are ignored by teachers. So before answering such questions we must know that what questions a child may develop after listening to a particular concept or topic.<p>
Creation of database of such intriguing & inquisitive questions and development of inquisitiveness is shown in a map below. Address the questions in the video as per the map.<br/>
