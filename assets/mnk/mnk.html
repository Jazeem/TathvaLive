<b>“THE TRUE SIGN OF INTELLIGENCE IS NOT KNOWLEDGE BUT IMAGINATION”</b><br>

<br/>
Machines and mechanisms have been enrapturing mankind since the beginning of time. Man always searched for the easy way out of any situation and the machines did just  that. They simplified life! Man has designed innumerable ingenious mechanisms to simplify his day to day life. Ranging from the very simple gears and four bar linkages to the complex valve timing mechanisms in IC engines the applications are numerous!<br>
 
The event aims at testing the mettle of a true engineer! Analyzing your spontaneity and skills at devising practical mechanism to solve a real life situation. This is a platform to think out of the box, where bookish knowledge will not suffice! Harnessing your creative knowledge, adding a dash of fun to top it all out.<br>
 
The task at your hand is to construct /design a machine, from the given materials, by satisfying the given conditions, and within the allotted time.<br>

<h3><font color="blue">PROBLEM STATEMENT</font></h3>
To design and fabricate a working model of a simple mechanism, specified on the spot, from the different materials provided. The materials include the necessary parts, tools and accessories essential to create the mechanism.

<h3><font color="blue">EVENT SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
 <ul>
<li> A team can consist of a maximum of four members.</li>
<li>Cross college teams are allowed.</li>
<li>The participants should produce a valid identity card of their institute.</li>
<li>The event will consist of two rounds: a preliminary written test and the finals.</li>
<li> The preliminary round will be of duration 60 minutes.
</li>
<li>This round is intended to test the logical and analytical aptitude of the contestants.
</li>
<li> In the second round, the contestants must design and fabricate a working model, specified on the spot.
</li>
<li>All the tools and materials required will be provided by the organisers.</li>
<li>Use of any materials other than that provided by the organisers, will lead to immediate disqualification.</li>
<li>Please contact the event manager before making any assumptions in order to avoid any cribs on the day of the event.</li>
<li>Selection of apt materials for the creation of a mechanism is an acquired skill. The stability and moreover the proper functioning of a mechanism depends on the links, their selection and geometry. Hence, practise the art of innovating from junk.</li>
</ul>
