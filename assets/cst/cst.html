<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
<br/><br/>The calmness of an assassin, willingness to sacrifice,<br/>
 Ability to take the heat, holding your own when cornered,<br/>
 Teamwork, thrill, taking the right hiding spot,<br/>
 Striking at the right moment, carrying the right weapons,<br/>
 Choosing the perfect hunting spot, playing the right tactics, <br/>
There is nothing you can&apos;t use in this game,<br/>
 And even a little extra of any will give you <br/>
The edge you need to succeed!<br/>

Planning, plotting, blood and pride, you need to put it all on the line, coz this is counter&ndash;strike!<br/>

Here, only the better team wins ...<br/><br/><br/>



Counter-Strike is a tactical first-person shooter which originated from a Half-Life modification. Counter-Strike pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won by either completing the mission objective or eliminating the opposing force. 
Come prove your clan's worth at Blitzkrieg!<br/>
