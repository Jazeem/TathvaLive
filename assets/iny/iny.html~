Started as Royal Indian Navy, the Indian Navy has come a long way since independence to emerge as one of the strongest naval forces in the world. With over 58,000 personnel and a huge operational fleet, it plays a very important role in the country’s defence.
The naval exhibition will showcase the different aspects of the navy and put on display the various models of the noteworthy ships as nuclear submarine INS Chakra and aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya. The naval exhibition will include a complete overview of the Indian Naval Academy which is the single largest naval training establishment, the detailed explanation of the procedures and workings of electronics warfare and information technology systems and a stunning display of arms and navigation systems. In a nutshell, the exhibitions will reveal the intricacies of one of our finest organisations.
