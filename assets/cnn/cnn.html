<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
<i>&quot;Do you remember the cartoons of Rube Goldberg? An inventor of the most ludicrous contraptions. You know: a lever is pulled, causing a boot to kick a dog, whose bark motivates a hamster to run on a wheel which winds a pulley that raises a gate that releases a bowling ball and so on? Until, at the end, finally, the machine does something incredibly mundane, like making a piece of toast. Yes? Well, as it turns out, that’s the world. All these incredibly complex, inscrutably intertwined Rube Goldberg machines that can only be seen in retrospect when something happens.&quot;</i><br/>

<h3><font color="blue">Problem Statement</font></h3>
<i><b>Create a contraption to guide two balls through two different paths so as to make them fall into a bucket at the same time.</b></i>

<h3><font color="blue">Rules and Regulations</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>	A team may consist of a maximum of six members.</li>
<li>	All teams should register online for participating in this event.</li>
<li>	The balls should start simultaneously.</li>
<li>	The distance between the starting point and bucket must not exceed 2.5m. </li>
<li>	Cross college teams will also be allowed to participate in the event.</li>
<li>	The team members should produce a valid identity card of their college.</li>
<li>	All Teams should submit an abstract to the event manager with Subject: Abstract-Contraption (Soft copy/Hard copy) on or before 10thOctober 2013.</li>

<b>Abstract should contain following details:</b>

<li>Tathva ID No.(Obtained after online registration)</li>

<li>Event ID No.</li>
<li>	Name of Participants.</li>
<li>	Plan or layout of the contraption.</li>
<li>	Total number of steps and a short description of each step. Sketches and flowcharts can be made about each step.</li>
<li>	The various energy conversions involved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	All teams must submit abstracts before the above mentioned date in order to get accommodation facility within the campus during the period of TATHVA '13.</li>
<li>	The contraption must have a minimum of 15 steps in total.</li>
<li>	A maximum of 1 hr. will be given for the teams to set up their contraptions.</li>
<li>	The participants can use any kind of ball of diameter less than 75 mm.(Not larger than a tennis ball).</li>
</ul>
	The following will be provided at the venue:
<br/>
a)	Bucket
<br/>
b)	Extension cord.
<br/>
c)	Benches and desks.


<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>
	<ul>
<li>The safety of the contraption must be satisfactory to the judges and the coordinators.</li>
<li>	If the judges feel that a particular idea is repeated in two or more different steps, the redundant steps won’t be counted among the 15 stipulated steps and points will be reduced.</li>
<li>	Judge’s decision shall be final and binding on all.</li>
<li>	Innovative steps will be awarded bonus points and shall be decided by the judge and coordinators.</li>

</ul>
	<ul>
<li>Total score, X = 15S + 25E – 15I – 5T – 10R + Q + J</li>
</ul>

<br/>
•	S = Total number of steps.
<br/>
•	E = Total number of energy conversion.
<br/>
•	I  = Number of interventions.
<br/>
•	T = Extra time taken by the second ball to reach the bucket in SECONDS.
<br/>
•	R = Number of repeating steps.
<br/>
•	Q = Abstract clarity(Out of 50 depending on similarity between abstract and contraption) .
<br/>
•	 J = Points for innovative steps (between 10 and 50 depending on the technique involved)
