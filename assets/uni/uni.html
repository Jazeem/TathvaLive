<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>

Have you ever felt the need for a customized operating system? Have you ever been dissatisfied by the tools that comes bundled with the software that you use? Or are you that person with a zeal to contribute towards the world of open source software? <br/>
<br/>
<b>The UNIX command line </b>interface is a time tested and solid piece of
technology that forms an important part of the software engineers
toolkit. While GUI interfaces are have a smooth learning curve and seem
more user friendly, advanced technical users prefer the customisability
and power offered by a command line interface to tasks ranging daily
work to programming and managing large systems. When work has to be done
remotely, the command line interface is vastly superior to any other
kind. When there's a lot of repetitive work that needs to be done, the
command line interface offers a quick escape. When there's a workflow
that needs to be automated, the command line comes to the rescue again.

The core UNIX toolchains for simple scripting, task management and
automation as well as the numerous command line utilities for things
like image processing, video manipulation, text analysis etc. have made
the environment very powerful. The basic tools have be reimplemented
repeatedly in various languages (e.g. make has been reimplemented as
rake in ruby, as grunt in javascript and as paver in Python).

Many programmers are not sufficiently exposed to the power of this
environment and are overly dependent on guis and web based
programs. This reduces their efficiency for many tasks and cripples
their productivity.

<b>Curriculum </b>
<br>-----------
<br>
This workshop offers an introduction to making the most of the UNIX
command line. It starts with an introduction to advanced features of the
command line itself. How you can edit, type 10x faster, create complex
commands quickly and get stuff done before your GUI using friend can get
the window to appear on the screen. After that, we dive into the
constructs the shell gives us to automate tasks. For example, how would
you resize 1000 images you just copied out of a camera and create
thumbnails? How would you spread the load across all the processors on
your machine? With the shell, it's one line
ls *.jpg | parallel -j 4 "convert {} -scale 10% {.}-thumb.png"
We'll cover things like this as well as how to do complex analysis using
simple tools without the overhead of writing programs to do it.
After that, we'll cover the "language" provided by the shell to do
simple scripting. This allows you do to quick and dirty scripts for many
common tasks without breaking out your compiler. Finally, we'll cover
power tools like imagemagick and ffmpeg etc. which allow you to do things
that seem magical. For example, we will write a tiny script that can
automate the process of creating a screencast and publishing it.
<br>

<b>What will you learn?</b>
<br>--------------------
<br>
You'll learn a fundamental skill that will greatly
increase your efficiency as a programmer and give you the ability to
work fast and quietly.
<br>
<b>Why should you learn this?</b><br>
--------------------------<br>
A lot of daily tasks that you do can be automated using simple command
line tools that will save you tons of time. Lack of knowledge in this
area will make you do things in a sub optimal fashion repeatedly sort of
line using a pair of pliers to drive a screw into a block of wood. Also,
with stuff moving to the cloud, often the only access to machines is via
headless prompt. Without advanced knowledge of the shell, this can be
very frustrating if not impossible.
