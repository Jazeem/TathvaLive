Are you bored of the game of zeros and ones? Are you a circuit geek looking for something more challenging, enthralling and fun? Are you fascinated by the bridge of analog electronics connecting the continuum of real world to the discrete digital world? Can the super computer of yours process and analyze analog circuits within minutes?
If you answer yes to the above questions you are in for <b>‘ANALOG IQ’</b>. 
<br/><b>ANALOGIQ</b> is about channelizing the participant’s knowledge, creativity and skill in analog circuits to design and implement analog systems with a great deal of simplicity and elegance in the least time.

<h3><font color="blue">Event format</font></h3>
ANALOGIQ is a analog circuit design contest and the problem statement will be revealed only at the time of event. According to the problem statement circuit is to be designed and implemented using discrete components and the Analog IC's listed in the specification.<br/>
Design problem will test contestants problem solving skills and will require understanding of basic circuits consists of Op-Amps, BJTs and other discrete components. 


<h3><font color="blue">Event specification</font></h3>
<ul>
Circuit is to be designed and implemented using the IC's listed below only:
<br/>
