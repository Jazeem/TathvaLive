<h3><font color="blue">Problem Statement</font></h3>
<i><b>Build a bot(wired/wireless) capable enough to attack the opponent bot in a provided battle arena.
One should control the bot  very tactically, such that it can withstand the opponent and drive it out of the arena as well.</b></i>

 ARENA SPECIFICATION:<br>
<li>  The diagram above represents a sample arena. </li>

<li> The arena consists of 2 wedges, 4 coloured regions and 2 pairs of grills with 3 sets of openings. It has a fence except at the grills. </li>

<li>  A and B are the starting positions. 	</li>

<li>  There are 2 pairs of grills with 3 sets of openings in each. </li>


<br>
BOT SPECIFICATION
<br>
<li>  The bots, at their maximum size (all retractable projections included) should fit into a box of dimensions 30cm x 30cm x 30cm. The measurements shall be done just before the start of the match. </li>

<li>  The weight of the machine should not exceed 10kg. </li>

<br>

<h3><font color="blue">Rules and Regulatitons</font></h3>

<li>  After every scoring session, there will be a reset (back to the starting position). </li>

<li>  The teams will be divided into groups depending on the number of participants.</li>

<li>  In the league, the team with the maximum number of wins will get into the next level.Each league match shall be 8 minutes long with a half time of 4 minutes. </li>

<li>  Pneumatic weaponry can be used. </li>

<li>  Robots can have any kind of miniature weapons with the following exceptions:</li>
</ul>


1)	Hydraulics.<br/>


2)	Liquid projectiles.<br/>


3)	Flame-based weapons.<br/>


4)	Nets, tape, glue, or any other entanglement device.<br/>


5)	Projectiles.<br/>


6)	Weapons should not come in contact with the arena or damage it.<br/>


7)	Radio jammers.<br/>


<li>  There should be no entanglement of the wires during the match.</li>

<li>  If a bot remains stationary for a time of 30 seconds, the opposition will be declared as winner. </li>

<li>  An interrupt will be given if and only if any technical problem occurs in between the match, but a penalty of 25 points will be awarded. </li>

<li>	Only the wireless one will get first interrupt for free.</li>

<li>	Maximum number of interrupts allowed in a match are 3.</li>

<li> Only electrical powered actuators are allowed. The power supply may be onboard or external. A maximum voltage of 24V D.C/A.C can be used to power the vehicle. </li>

<li> The wires should be projected to a minimum height of 25cm. </li>

<li> Participants should bring the required length of wire (minimum 3.5 meters along with them. The wires should remain slack throughout the match).</li>

<li> A tolerance of 5% is allowed in the above mentioned dimensional & power specifications, taking into consideration the error of the measuring instruments that we use here and those used by the participants in the making of the robot. This relaxation is scientific & tolerable. </li>

<li> Ready-made chassis are not allowed and would lead to the disqualification of the team.</li>


</ul>
