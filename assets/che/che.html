<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
At the start of the 20th century, Henry Ford planned to fuel his Model Ts with ethanol. Almost at the same time, one morning in 1935, The Dallas Morning News reported a demonstration of a water fuelled car by Charles H.Garrett.  Attempts have always been made to run vehicles on chemical reactions all around the world.<br/>

Sir Henry Royce said &quot;<i>Strive for perfection in everything you do. Take the best that exists and make it better. When it does not exist, design it</i>.&quot; At Tathva 13 gear up your roadsters against the best techies across India, for an ultimate test of endurance, to leave your opponents baffled in the heat of the reactions.

<h3><font color="blue">PROBLEM STATEMENT </font></h3>
<i><b>Design and fabricate a self-propelled car which runs on a controlled chemical reaction and completes the specified track in minimum time.</b></i>

<h3><font color="blue">SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
<b>General Specifications</b><br/>

1.	Maximum of four members per team. Cross college teams are allowed.<br/>


2.	Team members should produce a valid ID card of their institution.<br/>


3.	Dimensions: The Car should fit into a box of size 30cm x 25cm x 20cm.<br/>

4.	Ready-made kits should not be used for the event (eg. LEGO).<br/>

5.	No commercial batteries, motors can be used. Motors if used must derive it's power from a chemical reaction. <br/>

6.	Use of hazardous chemicals like dynamite, fireworks, mercuric chloride, white phosphorous, nitroglycerin are strictly forbidden.<br/>

7.	Cellulose, Aluminium alkyls, gunpowder and other explosive chemicals should not be used for the propulsion.<br/>

8.	Poisonous gases like Hydrogen Cyanide, fluorine and chlorine etc should not be emitted from the machine during the event.<br/>

9.	The car must not damage the track. If it does, the team will be disqualified.<br/>

10.	Teams may be given a second chance and/or re-try after the initial rounds based on the competition and necessity. The decision of the judges will be final and binding to all.<br/>

11.	Decision of judges and coordinators is final and all the teams shall abide by it.<br/>

12.Every component of the car will be subject to examination and a small abstract on the working of the car should be submitted at the time of the event.<br/>

<b>Event Format</b><br/>

1.	Each team will be given three rounds for running their car on the track and points will be given separately for each round.<br/>

2.	The best performance out of the three would be considered for final evaluation.



<h3><font color="blue">ARENA SPECIFICATIONS</font></h3>
1.	The track will be straight with different turfs of sand, wet area (water till tire level only; floating mechanism is not required), lubrication(wax) and inclinations.<br/>

2.	The length of the track will be 6m.<br/>

3.	There will be walls along both the edges of the track (only one wall is shown in the model track for convenience).<br/>

4.	The model track is only a probable estimate of the actual track, uploaded for the ease of the participants. Actual track may vary slightly from the model track.

<h3><font color="blue">JUDGING CRITERIA</font></h3>
1.	The car which reaches the end point in the shortest time wins.<br/>

2.	The car must touch all surfaces of the track, if not points will be given according to the number of surfaces the car touches.<br/>
3.	If two cars reach the end point in the same time, points will be given to the innovation of the chemical reaction used.The weight of the car will also be a criteria for judging.The lighter car gains more points. <br/>

4.	The final decision lies with the judges.
