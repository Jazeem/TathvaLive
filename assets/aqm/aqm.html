<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>


<i>&quot;Water is the driving force of all nature.&quot; </i><br/>
&ndash;Leonardo da Vinci<br/>
<br/>

From agriculture to factories and hydropower, we use water in a million different ways every day. But do we really know all the secrets of this wonderful creation? Here at Aqua Missile, we attempt to invoke a small fragment of its true power into launching a water powered rocket.

<h3><font color="blue">Problem statement</font></h3>
<i><b>The participants are required to design and build a single stage water rocket and its launcher. The water rocket and launch pad should be designed with safety in mind. Participants can adopt any design for nose and fins </b></i> .

<h3><font color="blue">Rules and regulations</font></h3>
TEAM SPECIFICATIONS<br/>
<br/>

<ul>
<li> A maximum of three members are allowed per team.</li>

<li> Team members have to produce valid ID card of the institute.</li>

<li>There can be students from different educational institutes in a single team.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li> The rocket body should be made only with plastic bottles of aerated soft drinks of maximum capacity 2L and should be free of any fabrication failures or dents caused by heat exposure.</li>
<br/>
<li> The water rocket must use only compressed atmospheric air as its source of energy. Pressure compressors (foot pump) shall be provided  at the venue. The pressure inside the container (rocket body) before launch should not exceed 70 psi.</li>
<br/>
<li> Water to be filled in the rockets will be provided by the organisers. The amount of water to be used is left to the choice of the team.</li>
<br/>
<li> Each team must have their own launchers. The rocket must be launched from a stationary position using a fixed launcher. Slingshots, trebuchets, catapults, cannons, and all other forms of launcher boost assists are strictly forbidden.In other words, the internal pressure of the rocket must be the only source of energy for the rocket.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
ROUND 1-ELIMINATION ROUND
<br/>
<br/>
Here the maximum range of the rocket will be measured:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>The testing field is a 30 degree sector with straight line cutting it into two halves. Only those rockets that land in the shaded region will proceed to the next round. </li>
<br/>
<li> Minimum cutoff is set at 70m.</li>
<br/>
<li>Points will be awarded for longer range and deducted for deviation from the centre line. The point where the tip lands will be considered for scoring.</li>
<br/>
<li> The teams will be given two trials. Participants are allowed to use two different rockets. Higher of the two points will be considered for scoring.<br/></li>
</ul>

<br/>
<br/>
ROUND 2-FINAL ROUND
<br/>
<br/>
Here the accuracy of the rocket is tested:
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>	Participants are required to launch the rocket from the launching point and try to hit central zone for maximum points.</li>
               <br/>
<li>Zone in which the impact point lies will be considered for scoring.</li>
<br/>

<li>	Two trials will be given to the participants and the better of the two will be considered as the Round 2 score.</li>
              <br/>
<li>The participants are allowed to use different rockets for both the trials.</li>
<br/>

<li>	The team  with the highest aggregate score after round 1 and 2  will be declared as the winner.</li>
</ul>

<br/>
<br/>
CRITERIA FOR DISQUALIFICATION
<br/>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>  Any rocket design which compromises safety regulations.</li>

<li> If the rocket blasts before the launch.</li>

<li> Launching of the rocket prior to indication by the organisers.</li>

<li> Any part of the rocket breaks off from the rocket during the flight.</li>

<li> Any ready-made models are used.</li>

<li>Splicing and multistage rockets are not allowed.</li>

<li> Any design rule is not abided by the participant.</li>
</ul>

The organizers reserve all rights to change any of the above rules as they deem fit. Changes in rules, if any, will be highlighted on the website. In case of any discrepancy, the decision of the judges shall be treated as final and binding on all.
