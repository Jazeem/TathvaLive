DotA, since the release of it's beta version, has become extremely popular in India and the competition has become more intense. In any LAN Cafe, one can walk in to find DotA 2 games in progress and many nights are wasted playing and discussing DotA 2. Come battle some of the best teams of South India at Blitzkrieg!
