This Tathva, unleash the engineer in you.<br/>
Get a chance to showcase a splendid project or just assess your engineering aptitude.<br/>
Gear up with your toolbox, for Young Engineer is your chance to battle it out with the best and take home laurels. <br/>
   


<h3><font color="blue">Project Expo</font></h3>
The event will take place in the form of two rounds:<br/>
<b>Screening round</b><br/>

<ul>
<li>Participants are required to submit a brief description of their project online.<br/></li><li>Images and videos of the projects are encouraged.<br/></li>
<li>Among the projects, a preliminary evaluation will be done by the organizers.</li><li> Top 40 teams will be selected for the final round.<br/></li>

</ul>
<b>Exhibition</b><br/>

<ul>
<li>The selected teams are to exhibit their projects during Tathva. <br/></li>
<li>It will be in the form of a public exhibition wherein the participants would have to describe their projects to the public as well as the judges. <br/></li>
<li>The judges would finally evaluate them and select 3 winning projects. <br/></li>
<li>Recommendations and feedback from the organizers would be provided for as many projects as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Engineering Aptitude</font></h3>

This section will consist of 2 rounds as described below:<br/><br/>


<b>Preliminary round</b><br/>

<ul>
<li>Written round, in a questionnaire format, will be conducted at various schools.<br/></li>
<li>The participants should form groups of 2 and attempt the questions.<br/></li>
<li>Questions will be more about observations and knowledge pertaining to the engineering discipline rather than a formal test of engineering aptitude. <br/></li>
<li>The preliminary round is open to all. <br/></li>
<li>The top 20 finalists will be notified through email.  </li>
</ul><br/>
<b>Hands-on round
</b><br/>
<ul>
<li>The second round comprises of a series of practical problems to be attempted by the teams at Tathva.<br/></li>
<li>The tasks would involve knowledge about the basic concepts of engineering.<br/></li><li>The problem statement will not be given beforehand.<br/></li>
<li>However, the participants will be introduced to a variety of concepts and other tutorials, through email.<br/></li>
<li>Top 3 teams will be declared as winners of the event and awarded prizes.</li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>
