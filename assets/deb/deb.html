<i>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</i> <br/>
 - Brian Kernighan <br/>
<br/>





Anyone can code. But can you make an already smartly written code perfect? The greatest of the coders gave the greatest of programs, but a simple error cost them huge! Here's a chance to find out their agony, a chance to see it through their eyes! We give you programmed solutions to various problems with the slight caveat that they don't work. Its up to you to fix it. Are you up to the task? 

<h3><font color="blue">Event Guidelines</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>Each team can consist of a maximum of two members.
</li>
<li> Each team will be provided one linux based system.</li>
<li> Compiling or debugging the code using any kind  of  applications is not permitted.</li>
<li> Resources like Internet etc. will not be allowed to be used.</li>
<li> The codes would be written in C/C++ and compiler used will be GCC.</li>
<li> There will be 3 stages in this event.</li>
<li>The time limit for the first two stages will be half an hour each and one hour for the third stage</li>
<li> The event will span for maximum of  two hour.</li>
<li> Any malpractice would lead to straight disqualification.</li>
</ul>


<h3><font color="blue">Event Description</font></h3>

<br>&bull;<b>Stage 1</b><br/>


The given code will be having syntactic errors.
Your job is to make the code error free without compiling it or using any debugger .
The code should be edited clean.
Proper indentation will be rewarded.<br/>
<br/>


&bull;<b>Stage 2</b><br/>


In this stage the problem would contain a code with multiple logical flaws.
Your job is to rectify the mistakes, fill up the flaws and make the code run as we want it to.
Code will be well-commented to guide you explaining what each fragment does achieve.
You will be rewarded if you stay as close to the original code as
possible.<br/>
<br/>




&bull;<b>Stage 3</b><br/>


In this stage the code is in a very &quot;interesting&quot; shape and
we mean literally. 
The entire code fragment does not have any proper indentation and clear spacing. 
Your job is to describe clearly what the program does.
You get more points if you are correct, concise and quick.


<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>


Only those teams who complete the previous stage within the time limit can pass on to the next stage. <br/>

Following are the parameters which will affect the scoring.<br/>

 <ul>
<li>Number of problems correctly solved</li>

<li> Time taken for each individual submission.</li>
<li> Number of lines added, modified or removed.</li>
<li> Damage to the overall structure of the original code.</li>
</ul>


The final score would be a weighted sum of all the above parameters.
<br>
The winning teams will be selected purely based on the total score accumulated by them.
