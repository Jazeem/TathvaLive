<h3><font color="blue">INTRODUCTION</font></h3>
 <p>    &nbspAn interesting platform for well-versed electrical & electronic enthusiasts to showcase their skills and an exciting challenge for the newbies. It is a platform to utilize academic skills in an interesting and innovative fashion so that being <i>"nerdy"</i> becomes the new fashion trend!</p>
                <p>    &nbspHere, we invite you to find your way through, beat the odds with your intelligent design, and prove your edge over the rest of the world!!</p>

<h3><font color="blue">Problem statement</font></h3>
<i><b>The objective is to design and implement an analog/digital circuit to play the specified game on the display of the Cathode Ray Oscilloscope by controlling the input signals to the CRO.
</i></b><br/>

<h3><font color="blue">Specifications</font></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Basic Game Description:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>	The game should contain THREE parallel paths.</li>
<li>	On each of the path, randomly moving obstacles are to be generated.</li>
<li>	The player's initial position should be below the THREE paths and final position above all the paths.</li>
<li>It should be manually controlled in such a way that the character should cross all the roads without hitting any obstacles.</li>
</ul>


<li><b>Optional Features:</b></li>
<ul>
<li>On hitting the obstacle, the game should be reset.</li>
<li>	 Additional levels, with increased obstacle speed or increased parallel paths.</li>
<li>	Display of time elapsed</li>

</ul>
</ol>

<h3><font color="blue">Event Rules</font></h3>
<ul>
<li>On hitting any of the obstacles, an indication should be given(like LED on or a BEEP sound).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The character should move only in the vertical direction.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The character <i>should not rest</i> between the parallel paths.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The input control should be given through push buttons. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A function generator, a variable DC source (0-15 V) and an oscilloscope will be provided.</li>
</ul><br/><br/>
<b>*Note</b> that, though the extra features contain a significant portion of allocated marks, they would be taken into consideration only when the participant has fully implemented the <i>basic specifications.</i>

<h3><font color="blue">Judging Criteria</font></h3>

<ul>
<li>	Simplicity of the circuit will be taken under consideration.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Complexity in the game will be considered.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Circuit <i>without</i> micro-controllers would be preferred.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>	Judges decision is final.</li>
</ul>
